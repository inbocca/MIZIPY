# MIZIPY



This software allows you to read and write MIZIP keys using the ACR122U reader.

Was written and tested in Python 3.9, not guaranteed to work with later versions.

#### Install MIZIPY and PY-ACR122U
```
git clone https://github.com/inbocca/MIZIPY.git
cd MIZIPY/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To interface with the reader I used Flowtter's Py-acr122u library, thanks a lot for the work!

#### Note
this project was thought up and written in 2 evenings, have mercy please.
